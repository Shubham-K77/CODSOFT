              Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway at 18, and she was 26, eight
              years his senior. Their marriage was hastily arranged, and Anne
              was pregnant six months later.

              While Shakespeare likely attended Stratford’s grammar school and
              mastered reading and Latin, his wife and two children who lived to
              adulthood, Susanna and Judith, were likely illiterate.

              Between 1585 and 1592, Shakespeare disappeared from historical
              records, leaving behind no paper trail. This period is often
              referred to as “the lost years” by historians.

              Shakespeare’s rivals, known as “The University Wits,” led by
              playwright Robert Greene, criticized his work as bombastic and
              unworthy of comparison to Oxford and Cambridge scholars.

              The only recorded instance of Shakespeare speaking is as a
              character witness in a court case, where he testified to the
              honesty of his landlord.

          <div class="normal-text">

              Shakespeare introduced almost 3,000 words to the English language,
              with estimates ranging from 17,000 to 29,000 words in his
              vocabulary, double that of the average conversationalist.
